God wants to make a message out of us
you cannot walk ij the grace of yesterday and get the resuts of today
it is the Holy Spirit that makes prophecies come to pass
pray for the grace for speed
pray for the holy spirit
pray for result
pry that something should rst upon my life
shiftv my life amd finances
pray for favor
pray that my life will draw men to God,
people should look at my
use me as a testament of wonder to attract men to your kingdom
men should look at my life and see the wonders of God
I surrende to you Lord
I Pledge that you alone will be glorified
john 17:1


the hour is come --- 
use me as a trophy to attract men to you
use me as a testament of wonder
my life is available to be a revelation
there's got to be more
I want mmy life to bear fruits
i want to be able to pray for the sicl and they are healed
people should see God's power through me
i am tired of what my power alone can get me, I need tyout empowerment, Holy Spirit
behind frail men, the holy spitit turns ordinary mento maifest spiritual possibilities

whatever you ask of me, i surrender  -- a song
